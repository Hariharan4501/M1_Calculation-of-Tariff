# M1_Calculation_of_Tariff
**#Introduction**
The amount of money framed by the supplier for the supply of electrical energy to various types of consumers is known as "electrical tariff".The tariff covers the total cost of producing and supplying electrical energy and in addition to reasonable cost.
The actual tariff that the consumer pay depends on the consumption of the eletricity. The industrial consumers pay more tariff because they use more power for long times than the domestic consumers. The electricity tariff depends on the following factors : 1) Type of load, Time at which load is required, The amount of energy used.
The total bill of consumer has these parts namely fixed charge, rate of charge, costumer charge, Electrical duty and no of units consumed.
Objective of Tariffs:
Tariff means the schedule of rates or charges. Tariff, in case of electric supply, means the schedule or rates framed for supply of electrical energy to different classes of consumers.

The main objective of the tariff is to distribute equitably the cost of supplying energy among the various classification of use.
Therefore, a tariff must cover the following items:

(i) Recovery of cost of capital investment in generat­ing, transmitting and distributing equipment.

(ii) Recovery of cost of operation, supplies and mainte­nance of equipment.

(iii) Recovery of cost of metering equipment, billing, col­lection costs and miscellaneous services, and
(iv) A satisfactory return on the total capital investment.
